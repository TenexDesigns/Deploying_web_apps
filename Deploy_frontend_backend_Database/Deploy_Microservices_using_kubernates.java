To deploy your backend that consists of four microservices (review service, catalog service, API gateway service, and service discovery service), you can containerize all four microservices using Docker and then use Kubernetes to manage them. Here are the general steps:

1. Containerize each microservice using Docker and create a Dockerfile for each microservice.
2. Upload the Docker images to a container registry such as Docker Hub or Google Container Registry.
3. Use Kubernetes to deploy the microservices. You can create a Kubernetes deployment for each microservice and define the number of replicas for each deployment.
4. Use Kubernetes to manage the microservices. You can use Kubernetes to scale the microservices up or down by increasing or decreasing the number of replicas.
5. Use Kubernetes to manage the service discovery. You can use Kubernetes to create a service for each microservice and define the endpoints for each service.
6. Use Kubernetes to manage the API gateway. You can use Kubernetes to create an API gateway service and define the routing rules for the microservices.

To deploy your backend, you can use the files of the code or the Docker containers that you uploaded to the cloud platforms. The cloud platforms that support Kubernetes can manage your Docker containers. You can deploy your backend using Kubernetes by creating a Kubernetes deployment for each microservice and defining the number of replicas for each deployment. 

These are general steps, and the specific implementation may vary depending on the requirements of the application and the hosting platform being used.
