In your scenario with four microservices (review service, catalogue service, API gateway service, and service discovery service), you can use Docker and Kubernetes to containerize, deploy, and manage these microservices efficiently. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. **Containerize Microservices with Docker**:
   - Begin by creating Docker containers for each of your microservices. These containers should encapsulate both the application code and its dependencies.
   - Write Dockerfiles for each microservice to define how the container should be built. These Dockerfiles should include instructions for copying your code into the container, specifying the runtime environment, and setting up any necessary configurations.
   - Build Docker images for each microservice using the Dockerfiles.
   - Push the Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, Amazon ECR) where they can be stored and accessed by Kubernetes.

2. **Deploy Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Set up a Kubernetes cluster either on your own infrastructure or using a managed Kubernetes service provided by cloud providers (e.g., Google Kubernetes Engine, Amazon EKS, Azure Kubernetes Service).
   - Ensure that you have `kubectl` (Kubernetes command-line tool) configured to communicate with your cluster.

3. **Deploy Kubernetes Resources**:
   - Create Kubernetes resource definitions for each of your microservices. These resource definitions include Deployment or StatefulSet objects to manage the deployment of containers.
   - You'll also create Service objects to expose your microservices within the cluster and optionally Ingress objects to route external traffic to your API gateway.

4. **Apply Kubernetes Resources**:
   - Use `kubectl` to apply the Kubernetes resource definitions to your cluster. This will instruct Kubernetes to create the necessary pods (containers), services, and other resources.

5. **Scaling and Management**:
   - Use Kubernetes' built-in scaling mechanisms (e.g., Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) to automatically scale your microservices up or down based on resource utilization or custom metrics.
   - Use Kubernetes features like ConfigMaps and Secrets for managing configuration and sensitive information.
   - Implement health checks and readiness probes to ensure the reliability of your microservices.

6. **Service Discovery**:
   - Depending on your service discovery requirements, Kubernetes provides a built-in DNS system for service discovery within the cluster. You can use service names to communicate between microservices.
   - If you have specific service discovery needs, you may use external tools or services, but Kubernetes can handle most internal service discovery tasks.

7. **API Gateway**:
   - Your API gateway service can be exposed through an Ingress resource in Kubernetes, which handles routing external HTTP traffic to the appropriate microservices.
   - You can configure and manage API gateway rules within your Ingress resource definition.

8. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implement monitoring and logging solutions to gain insights into the health and performance of your microservices and the Kubernetes cluster itself. Popular tools include Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack.

9. **Continuous Deployment (Optional)**:
   - Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of updates to your microservices, ensuring a smooth development and deployment process.

In summary, you use Docker to containerize your microservices, and Kubernetes to manage and orchestrate these containers. Kubernetes handles deployment, scaling, and service discovery, making it a powerful platform for deploying and managing microservices-based applications. Deploying your microservices using Kubernetes is a common practice in modern application development due to its flexibility and scalability.
