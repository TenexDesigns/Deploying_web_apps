To deploy your backend which is made up of four microservices using Docker and Kubernetes, you can follow these steps:

1. Build Docker images for each of your microservices.
2. Deploy the Docker images to a Docker registry such as Docker Hub or Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
3. Create a Kubernetes manifest file for each of your microservices.
4. Apply the Kubernetes manifest files to a Kubernetes cluster.

The Kubernetes manifest file will define the deployment, service, and other resources required to deploy your microservice.

Once you have applied the Kubernetes manifest files, Kubernetes will deploy your microservices to the cluster. Kubernetes will also manage the lifecycle of your microservices, including scaling them up or down as needed.

Here are some additional tips for deploying your backend using Docker and Kubernetes:

* Use a service mesh such as Istio or Linkerd to provide service discovery, load balancing, and other features for your microservices.
* Use a configuration management tool such as Ansible or Chef to manage the configuration of your microservices environment.
* Use a monitoring tool such as Prometheus or Grafana to monitor the performance of your microservices.

You can use any cloud platform that supports Kubernetes to deploy your backend. Some popular cloud platforms that support Kubernetes include:

* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

To deploy your backend to a cloud platform, you will need to create a Kubernetes cluster on the cloud platform. Once you have created a Kubernetes cluster, you can deploy your microservices to the cluster using the steps above.

I recommend that you start by learning about Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a popular and widely used container orchestration platform for deploying microservices. It is well-documented and has a large and active community of users and developers. Once you have learned Kubernetes, you can then start to learn about other tools such as Istio, Linkerd, and Ansible.
